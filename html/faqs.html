                            The Faculty Review Committee is a team of UConn faculty from various scientific 
                            disciplines that has been selected to review undergraduate student papers and score 
                            them based on the Official USJ Rubric - Faculty (we will link this one too) through 
                            a double blind review process.

                            A double blind process is a review process in which the identity of the author of a 
                            submitted paper is concealed from the reviewer and the identity of the reviewer is 
                            concealed from the author. This process was decided to be the fairest review process 
                            by the USJ leadership and will serve as an assurance of impartial paper selection 
                            for publication.
