                            Dr. Thanh Nguyen is an associate professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department 
                            at the University of Connecticut and the principal investigator of the Nguyen Research 
                            Group. The research group focuses on developing the properties of natural and synthetic 
                            materials that can be applied to biological systems. More specifically, they integrate 
                            automated and adaptive technology to biomedical devices at the nano/micro scales. Nguyen 
                            obtained his PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, working 
                            alongside Professor Michael McAlpine. At Princeton, Nguyen cultivated a passion for biointerfaced 
                            nanopiezoelectrics which he now continues to study in his lab. To complete postdoctoral research, 
                            he transitioned to MIT and worked on developing a technology that creates 3-D microstructures of 
                            biomaterials that could be applied to vaccine/drug delivery systems as well as medical implantation.

                            Currently, Nguyen and his research colleagues are focused on regenerative engineering 
                            with biomaterials, drug delivery systems, and nanotechnology. Ritopa Das, biomedical 
                            engineering PhD student and graduate research assistant at the Nguyen Research Group, 
                            has been working alongside Dr. Nguyen since 2017. Das explained that they are developing 
                            piezoelectric materials (those which can reversibly convert mechanical energy to electrical 
                            energy) to act as scaffolds for tissue regeneration in humans. By applying mechanical 
                            stimulation (such as through physiotherapy or through ultrasound vibrations), the produced 
                            electrical cues can attract cells into the scaffold and facilitate tissue healing. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                        The cycle of testing a piezoelectric material takes around two to three years. First, the group 
                        develops a biophysical profile of the material based on its durability and biodegradability. The 
                        group then moves on to biological testing in an artificial environment to analyze the material’s 
                        regenerative capabilities in a variety of different cells. Finally, the material is finally 
                        introduced into animals (typically mice), via surgery, and the effects on cell proliferation 
                        and tissue healing are monitored. Using histology, the group analyzes skin regeneration by 
                        checking for new growth at hair follicles. According to Das, tissue engineering like this will 
                        take around another decade to become more mainstream in bone and wound rehabilitation. 

                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                            “The main takeaway from our research is that you should look at adding chemical stimulation or 
                            adding biological stimulation to your tissue in order to increase rehabilitation, but physical 
                            stimulation like electricity or mechanical forces are equally as important,” Das said. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                            Das also adds that while they have ultimately proved that this material can work to regenerate 
                            tissue, they must work on optimizing tissue scaffolding technology. For example, now that they 
                            know how effective ultrasound is when applied to the piezoelectric material, they must explore 
                            the specificity of what intensity, frequency, and charge must be applied to optimize tissue 
                            regeneration. They should also test the materials in more animals before this technology can 
                            be applied in clinical trials.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">
                            “For me, it [this project] was very interesting because I know a lot of people who have broken 
                            bones, I know a lot of people who have arthritis, knee pain, broken ligaments, broken tendons, 
                            so I can in a very tangible way see how my research can make the lives of these people better,
                            ” Das said.
                        </p>
