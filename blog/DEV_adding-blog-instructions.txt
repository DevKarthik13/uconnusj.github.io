Instructions for how to add a blog to the site:

1) Duplicate "DEV_blog-template.html" in the "/uconnusj.github.io/blog/" directory.
2) Rename the file to "blog_yyyy-mm-dd.html" (yyyy-mm-dd being subsitituted with the actual date).
   This is VERY important.
3) Under banner for "START Blog content," fill in "blog_yyyy_mm_dd" with the correct date.

That's all you have to do for that file! The next one is "blog-content.js"

4) Simple create a new blog object in the blogs dictionary. This can be conveniently done just by
   copying 

Still, some important notes for this:

- You MUST name the blog post "blog_yyyy_mm_dd," (again, yyyy_mm_dd being subsitituted with the actual date)
- Note carefully how the date object is created (e.g. new Date("November 2, 2023"))
- The author name needs to be correct. If the author name does not appear in the list of members, the page
  WILL throw an error which will appear at the bottom of the page (something along the lines of "author not
  found, please contact USJ web dev team").
- The image source should be the name of a file in "/uconnusj.github.io/images/blogs/". Currently, the blog
  formatter assumes that there is always a header image.
- In the content attribute of the blog, make sure that paragraphs are separated with double returns.
- The content attribute of the blog can also include html code (see end of the example below) in case you
  need to insert any images or other elements into the post.

Finally, here's an example of a blog object:

blog_2024_03_01:{
    date:new Date("March 1, 2024"),
    title:`Bio-Integrated “Smart” Materials and Structures Research Group ${em} Dr. Thanh Nguyen`,

    content:
        `
            Dr. Thanh Nguyen is an associate professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department 
            at the University of Connecticut and the principal investigator of the Nguyen Research 
            Group. The research group focuses on developing the properties of natural and synthetic 
            materials that can be applied to biological systems. More specifically, they integrate 
            automated and adaptive technology to biomedical devices at the nano/micro scales. Nguyen 
            obtained his PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, working 
            alongside Professor Michael McAlpine. At Princeton, Nguyen cultivated a passion for biointerfaced 
            nanopiezoelectrics which he now continues to study in his lab. To complete postdoctoral research, 
            he transitioned to MIT and worked on developing a technology that creates 3-D microstructures of 
            biomaterials that could be applied to vaccine/drug delivery systems as well as medical implantation.

            Currently, Nguyen and his research colleagues are focused on regenerative engineering 
            with biomaterials, drug delivery systems, and nanotechnology. Ritopa Das, biomedical 
            engineering PhD student and graduate research assistant at the Nguyen Research Group, 
            has been working alongside Dr. Nguyen since 2017. Das explained that they are developing 
            piezoelectric materials (those which can reversibly convert mechanical energy to electrical 
            energy) to act as scaffolds for tissue regeneration in humans. By applying mechanical 
            stimulation (such as through physiotherapy or through ultrasound vibrations), the produced 
            electrical cues can attract cells into the scaffold and facilitate tissue healing.

            The cycle of testing a piezoelectric material takes around two to three years. First, the group 
            develops a biophysical profile of the material based on its durability and biodegradability. The 
            group then moves on to biological testing in an artificial environment to analyze the material’s 
            regenerative capabilities in a variety of different cells. Finally, the material is finally 
            introduced into animals (typically mice), via surgery, and the effects on cell proliferation 
            and tissue healing are monitored. Using histology, the group analyzes skin regeneration by 
            checking for new growth at hair follicles. According to Das, tissue engineering like this will 
            take around another decade to become more mainstream in bone and wound rehabilitation.

            “The main takeaway from our research is that you should look at adding chemical stimulation or 
            adding biological stimulation to your tissue in order to increase rehabilitation, but physical 
            stimulation like electricity or mechanical forces are equally as important,” Das said.

            Das also adds that while they have ultimately proved that this material can work to regenerate 
            tissue, they must work on optimizing tissue scaffolding technology. For example, now that they 
            know how effective ultrasound is when applied to the piezoelectric material, they must explore 
            the specificity of what intensity, frequency, and charge must be applied to optimize tissue 
            regeneration. They should also test the materials in more animals before this technology can 
            be applied in clinical trials.

            “For me, it [this project] was very interesting because I know a lot of people who have broken 
            bones, I know a lot of people who have arthritis, knee pain, broken ligaments, broken tendons, 
            so I can in a very tangible way see how my research can make the lives of these people better,
            ” Das said.

            Professor Nguyen is open to inviting any interested undergraduate students to join his lab.
