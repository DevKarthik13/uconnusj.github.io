            <p>
              The UConn Undergraduate Science Journal is an online, open-access, peer-reviewed academic journal
               dedicated to the select publication of independent research conducted by UConn undergraduate 
               students within all STEM disciplines, that is any research that explores the physical sciences 
               using the scientific method. Every submission will undergo a double-blind peer review process by 
               the USJâ€™s Student Editor Committee and will be scored on scientific value, methodology, writing, 
               and results. The top papers will be reviewed by the Faculty Review Committee, which consists of 
               appointed faculty members from Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, 
               Computer Science and Engineering, and Cognitive Science and will be scored on a similar rubric. 
               Any UConn student with a complete scientific research paper that meets the USJ requirements is 
               eligible to apply. Members of the club will gain insight into the process of scientific writing 
               and publishing scientific research through editing, scoring, and publishing the journal. 
               The applicants will learn the process of submission and approval of scientific research papers. 
               The journal is set to promote student scientific research among the UConn undergraduate student 
               body and hopes to eliminate some barriers of getting STEM research published by undergraduate students.

                        through a double blind review process (see below) and score each paper based on the Official 
                        USJ Rubric (we will link the rubric here when we develop it). Every member of the UConn 
                        Undergraduate Science Journal is eligible to apply to become a part of the Student Review 
                        Committee.

                        A double blind process is a review process in which the identity of the author of a 
                        submitted paper is concealed from the reviewer and the identity of the reviewer is 
                        concealed from the author. This process was decided to be the fairest review process 
                        by the USJ leadership and will serve as an assurance of impartial paper selection 
                        for publication.
